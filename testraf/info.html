            <h2>Inkblots</h2>
            <p>Inkblots is an NFT project on Fantom Opera Network, which revolves around 500 completely unique Inkblot NFTs. Users will be able to mint only 1 Inkblot per transaction. This is so they can get a clear first impression the moment they buy it. and become the owners of these unique NFTs. They are then free to do with them as they wish. They are perfect to be used as avatars, because no two of them are the same. Owners are also free to sell these NFTs on any marketplace they wish. We are also developing a fun use case for them under the idea of the Rorschach test, it is detailed below.
            </p>
            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>Some of the Inkblots are simply abstract ideas, others took some inspiration from different media, memes, objects of reality, real Rorschach inkblots. In the end, they all look unique, distinguishable and are open to multiple interpretations.</p>
            <h2>Network</h2>
            <p>Inkblots will be deployed on the Fantom Opera Network.</p>
            <h2>Cost</h2>
            <p>100 FTM per mint.</p>
            <h2>Moment of purchase</h2>
            <p>The moment users purchase one Inkblot, they will be shown their purchased NFT for exactly 3 seconds, and then it will be hidden from them, and they will then have to describe what they saw in no more than 50 characters. Their answer will be listed in the description of the Inkblot.</p>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The idea behind this project is to see how each piece will be valued in an open market, seeing as how they are all unique, abstract, and open to multiple interpretations. I am very curious to see how their value will evolve with time, and which pictures have more demand, or get passed around the most.</p>
            <h2>Rarity</h2>
            <p>All of the Inkblot NFTs are considered ultra-rare because they are all uniquely made from scratch. They are specific handcrafted images with no moving parts between them, or randomization of elements.</p>
            <h2>Black and White</h2>
            <p>All of the Inkblots are exclusively in black and white. This is an authorial creative decision with one simple reason: For there to be no inherent difference in rarity, besides the fundamental image and the value each user places on it.</p>
            <h2>Rorschach test</h2>
            <p>Rorschach test will be a special feature on inkblots.xyz. Users will be shown one completely random Inkblot which they haven't seen before, for exactly 3 seconds and they will then haveto describe what they saw in no more than 50 characters. Their answer will be submitted to the blockchain as a transaction and will be listed in the gallery page on the website. Users will only be able to see descriptions if they have already put in their own description. This is to avoid bias as to what the picture represents. As this is a transaction, users will have to pay a small gas fee to do the transaction. This will be limited to 25 submissions per Inkblot, so as to
                not clog up each piece. (WIP feature and idea)</p>
            <h2>Roadmap</h2>
            <p>
